# On The Fly Staffing

## About 

On The Fly Staffing was developed to make the hiring process in the restaurant industry easier for all involved.  Applicants can submit a single application that will be archived in a database that is searchable by employers.  Employers are able to search the pool of applicants by position or availablity.  They are also able to save a candidate's profile and send an SMS invite to schedule an interview.
